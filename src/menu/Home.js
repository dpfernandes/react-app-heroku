        This project is a colaboration between Hack Your Future Copenhagen and THREAD</h3>
        <p class="content-text">THREAD is a dynamic and innovative collaboration of diverse partners from business, 
        design, education, research and refugee support agencies aiming to achieve life-changing 
        results for women who are forging new lives in Denmark.
        Integration is a key problem for refugees and their host countries. 
        This project seeks to help solve this problem by developing and testing a pioneering
        themed model of Empowerment, Employment and Entrepreneurship opportunities. The model 
        offers a step-change programme to women refugees with differing levels of life experience 
        and educational qualifications, which may be accessed according to their individual 
        confidence and competence.
